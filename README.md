Basic R Shiny App for walking a person or co-operative group through a Cambist Booking

I created this for a team building session at work. It might be useful for introducing people to the idea of Cambist Booking, or playing it in certain settings.
It doesn't facilitate the original multi-player game you can do with the physical cards, but instead runs one person through the process, allowing them to loop back to their first card at any time by clicking "Close Book".
Given the game isn't really interactive in terms of the underlying mechanics (the interpersonal card-swapping element is just a way to physically get the cards, and the people, moving around and mixing), this still produces the same underlying "game" for the individual player.
I used it by getting everyone to play one game and talk to each other about their trade-off values but then write down individual answers, which they multiplied through at the end. However, it would work fine with everyone agreeing an option, or even everyone working through their own game on their own app.

For the "cards", I used the list from [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RD1YvRjU1At6MMPXDO99ASdxUbHQ35E164ebyOWgTrc/edit?usp=sharing) someone on LW had made for use in a physical game, but edited it to remove obviously "rationalist community" inclusions, as I wasn't playing with a rat/SSC/ACX/LW group in any sense. You can just use whatever list you fancy, of course.

For a full explanation of how the game works, see [this LW article](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fXMWri2XgMFNf2yBP/cambist-booking).
